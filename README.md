Fullstack DEV. As a programming language enthusiast I've worked with many different stacks.

## Dotfiles
I'm storing configuration I use for new systems in github repo: https://github.com/nxy7/dotfiles
My main goal here is to have easily reproducible systems with nix + home-manager, which allows me to
spin up new machines and have them set up as my main one really easily. My dotfiles are always work in
progress and I don't always keep them up to date on GH.
